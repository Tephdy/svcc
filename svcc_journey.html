                            <p class="card-text">Founded by social entrepreneurs and academics <b>Simeon</b> and <b>Marina Chavez</b> in <b>1999</b>, the St. Vincent College of Cabuyao, Inc. (SVCC) owed its beginnings to a group of passionate educators who were displaced
                                from work due to the closing of another school in a nearby municipality. This group of veteran teachers knew of the couples’ reputation as successful and altruistic entrepreneurs who are highly respected in their community.
                                These displaced teachers approached the Chavezes to convince them to get into the business of education.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">It did not take a lot of convincing as the Chavez family immediately agreed and saw the proposition as another opportunity to help the community and these teachers who needed work. Being both from families of humble backgrounds,
                                Simeon and Marina understood how an education is a source of one’s heightened sense of dignity and a ticket out of poverty. They wanted to provide their kababayans access to quality private education without the prohibitive
                                tuition fees.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">From a total population of 110 students on its first year, SVCC has established itself as a reputable educational institution in the first district of Laguna province. Twenty years after it opened its doors to Cabueño children
                                eager to learn, it now has a total population of almost 7,000 and it continues to grow annually</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Set in a 3-hectare property, the campus is popular for its very invigorating lush landscaping hardly found in other schools in the area. SVCC continues to expand its physical area to ensure the comfort and safety of its ever
                                growing population, while ensuring an environment highly conducive to creativity and learning.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">We believe in contributing to the levelling of the playing field by providing access to affordable but quality and relevant education. Our founders have ingrained in the fiber of our institution that we are not in the business
                            of building an enterprise, but rather in the the ministry of building lives.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">We believe that the whole is greater than the individual parts. Although we recognize and celebrate outstanding individual inputs, we know that properly guided synergistic teamwork, anchored on noble and honorable goals, will produce
                            even greater results. Thus, we adhere to strong collaborative, mutuallyreinforcing, efficient, and responsible working systems.

                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">We promote the culture of resiliency by recognizing, understanding, and appropriately responding to challenges posed by constant and disruptive changes in the institutional environment and develop appropriate and calibrated responses
                            consistent with the Institution’s Vision, Mission, Institutional Philosophy and Values.
